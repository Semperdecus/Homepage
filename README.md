Website build using:

- [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) v15 (Pages Router)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) v3.x
- Netlify

(in recordtime, don't expect pretty code)

### Setting Up Locally

If you're doing it locally, start with clicking the [use this template](https://github.com/netlify-templates/nextjs-blog-theme/generate) button on GitHub. This will create a new repository with this template's files on your GitHub account. Once that is done, clone your new repository and navigate to it in your terminal.

From there, you can install the project's dependencies by running:

```shell
npm install
```

Finally, you can run your project locally with:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and visit <http://localhost:3000>

## Testing

### Included Default Testing
